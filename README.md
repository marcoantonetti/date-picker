I created this date-picker proyect to keep increasing my profficiency in TypeScript and JavaScript and problem-solving logic

I used npm to install date-fns library to handle the dates logic and to set up parcel as my bundler 

I hard coded this with a modular programming mindset, hence my TypeScript script has only 3 eventListeners and 3 functions to handle all of the logic.

Please, feel free to interact with the calendar. You can navigate through the months with the arrow buttons and it will show you the real dates of that month. Also you can select a specific date and it will update the button and remain highlighted.
